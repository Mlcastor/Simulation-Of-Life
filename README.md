# Artificial Life Simulation Project

### Summary
The "Artificial Life Simulation" encapsulates a highly detailed and dynamic artificial ecosystem. The project aims to create a 2D world where various cell types interact, evolve, and adapt based on simulated environmental conditions and genetic principles. The system simulates complex behaviors and socio-political dynamics through energy dynamics, genetic evolution, and cell interactions. Below are the comprehensive technical requirements for building such a simulation.

### Contributions
The project is a "work in progress" and won't accept any pull request until the release of the version 1.0
